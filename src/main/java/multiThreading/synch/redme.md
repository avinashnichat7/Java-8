*//there two m/c one is for produce item and 2nd is consume the item

for produce m/c at a time one will produce the item
for consume m/c at a time one item will consume the item
so this we want to achieved
one time producer one item and consumer one item
it should not produce 1, 2 item and consume nothing so
this kind of problem will solve it

OUTPUT:
producer 1
consumer 1
produce 2
consumer 2
